- [ ] **Advanced Capability Assessment**: Multi-dimensional competency rubrics and certification

### **üîß INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Phase 3+)**
- [ ] **Payment Provider Integration** (moved from K.1): Stripe/billing infrastructure
- [ ] Additional SSO providers (Azure AD, Okta) beyond initial OIDC/SAML
- [ ] Reputation signals: peer endorsements and anomaly detection
- [ ] Matrix/WebRTC exploration for real‚Äëtime collaboration

## Notes

### **üéØ Strategic Pivot Rationale**
- **Core Value First**: Self-bootstrapping and continuously learning agents are our unique differentiator
- **Validation Before Monetization**: Prove revolutionary capabilities before building commodity billing infrastructure
- **Infrastructure Ready**: Sandbox environments, security policies, and interoperability provide foundation for intelligent agents
- **Market Differentiation**: Focus on what makes us special - agents that truly learn, adapt, and improve themselves

### **üìã Implementation Guidelines**
- Keep Phase 2 focused on **core intelligence capabilities** and supporting infrastructure
- Defer billing/payment infrastructure to Phase 3 after core capabilities are validated
- Prioritize learning loops, self-bootstrapping, and collaborative intelligence over commercial features
- Maintain small PRs and comprehensive testing for all learning capabilities
