## 🤖 Agent Builder Component Overview

**Milestone**: AB.X - [Component Name]
**Priority**: High - Core Self-Bootstrapping Capability
**Type**: Agent Builder Implementation

## 📋 Context

**Strategic Importance**: This component enables the revolutionary self-bootstrapping capability where agents specialize themselves from simple natural language prompts like "Become a UX designer specializing in mobile apps."

**Dependencies**:
- [ ] Milestone H.1 (MCP/A2A protocols) ✅ COMPLETE
- [ ] Milestone N.1 (Sandbox environments) ✅ COMPLETE
- [ ] Other dependencies: [List any specific dependencies]

## 🎯 Scope & Deliverables

### **Self-Bootstrapping Functionality**
- [ ] **Natural Language Processing**: Parse and understand specialization prompts
- [ ] **Agent Blueprint Generation**: Create structured agent specifications
- [ ] **Capability Selection**: Choose appropriate tools and capabilities
- [ ] **Instructions Pack Creation**: Generate specialized prompts and configurations

### **Technical Components**
- [ ] **Backend Services**: [List specific services/modules to implement]
- [ ] **Database Schema**: [Any new tables for agent blueprints/templates]
- [ ] **API Endpoints**: [New endpoints for agent building functionality]
- [ ] **Template System**: [Prompt templates and capability configurations]

### **Integration Points**
- [ ] **MCP/A2A Integration**: Advertise generated capabilities
- [ ] **Sandbox Integration**: Test generated agents safely
- [ ] **Security Integration**: Apply policies to generated agents

## 🔬 Acceptance Criteria

### **Self-Bootstrapping Requirements**
- [ ] Successfully parses natural language specialization prompts
- [ ] Generates appropriate agent blueprint for intended role
- [ ] Selects relevant capabilities and excludes inappropriate ones
- [ ] Creates functional Instructions Pack that enables role-specific behavior

### **Quality Requirements**
- [ ] Generated agents demonstrably different from generic agents
- [ ] Role-appropriate responses and capabilities
- [ ] Consistent specialization across multiple generations
- [ ] Proper error handling for ambiguous or invalid prompts

### **Integration Requirements**
- [ ] Generated agents work with existing MCP/A2A infrastructure
- [ ] Sandbox testing validates agent functionality
- [ ] Security policies apply correctly to generated agents

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### **Unit Testing**
```python
# Example test structure
def test_prompt_parsing():
    # Test natural language prompt parsing
    prompt = "Become a UX designer specializing in mobile apps"
    blueprint = parse_agent_brief(prompt)
    assert blueprint.role == "UX Designer"
    assert "mobile apps" in blueprint.specialization

def test_capability_selection():
    # Test appropriate capability selection
    blueprint = AgentBlueprint(role="UX Designer")
    capabilities = select_capabilities(blueprint)
    assert "wireframe.create" in capabilities
    assert "code.compile" not in capabilities

def test_instructions_generation():
    # Test Instructions Pack generation
    blueprint = AgentBlueprint(role="UX Designer")
    pack = generate_instructions_pack(blueprint)
    assert "user experience" in pack.system_prompt.lower()
```

### **Integration Testing**
- [ ] End-to-end agent generation and deployment
- [ ] Generated agent performs role-specific tasks
- [ ] Integration with sandbox for safe testing
- [ ] MCP/A2A capability advertisement works correctly

## 📊 Success Metrics

**Self-Bootstrapping Effectiveness**:
- [ ] 90%+ success rate in generating functional specialized agents
- [ ] Generated agents score higher on role-specific tasks than generic agents
- [ ] Specialization is measurably different across different roles

**User Experience**:
- [ ] Agent generation completes in < 30 seconds
- [ ] Clear feedback during generation process
- [ ] Intuitive natural language prompt interface

## 🔗 Related Work

**Dependencies**: 
- Issue #[X]: [Related issue]
- Milestone N.2: Autonomous Learning (for continuous improvement)
- Milestone DSPy.1: Prompt Optimization (for better Instructions Packs)

**Follow-up Work**:
- [ ] Integration with learning loops for self-improvement
- [ ] Advanced specialization with domain-specific knowledge
- [ ] Multi-agent collaboration and role coordination

## 📝 Implementation Notes

**Key Libraries**:
- LangChain (MIT) - Natural language processing and prompt engineering
- Pydantic (MIT) - Agent blueprint schema validation
- Jinja2 (BSD-3-Clause) - Instructions Pack template generation
- spaCy (MIT) - Natural language understanding

**Development Approach**:
- Start with simple role parsing and expand complexity
- Use template-based approach for Instructions Pack generation
- Implement comprehensive validation for generated agents
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing agent infrastructure

**Example Agent Brief Parsing**:
```python
# Input: "Become a UX designer specializing in mobile apps for 3 months to improve onboarding by 15%"
# Output: AgentBlueprint(
#   role="UX Designer",
#   specialization="mobile apps",
#   duration="3 months", 
#   objectives=["improve onboarding by 15%"],
#   capabilities=["research.interviews", "wireframe.lofi", "usability.test"]
# )
```
