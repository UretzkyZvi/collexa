# Strategic Pivot Summary: Core Intelligence First

## 🎯 Strategic Decision

**Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Decision**: Deprioritize K.1 (Payment Provider Integration) and focus on core intelligent agent capabilities that differentiate our platform.

**Rationale**: 
- Self-bootstrapping and continuously learning agents are our unique value proposition
- Billing infrastructure is commodity functionality that can be implemented after proving core capabilities
- We have the necessary infrastructure (sandboxes, security, interoperability) to implement learning features now
- Market differentiation comes from intelligent agents, not payment processing
