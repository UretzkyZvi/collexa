# Service Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The original billing and usage services were becoming too large and handling multiple responsibilities. This document outlines the refactoring that split them into smaller, focused services following the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Before Refactoring

### Issues with Original Services

**BillingService (300+ lines)**
- Customer management (create, get, update)
- Checkout session creation
- Subscription lifecycle management
- Webhook event processing
- Usage reporting to payment providers

**BudgetService (280+ lines)**
- Budget CRUD operations
- Usage recording and tracking
- Budget enforcement and validation
- Usage summary generation
- Budget period calculations

**MeteringService (320+ lines)**
- Cost calculations and pricing
- Agent invocation recording
- Learning usage recording
- Storage usage recording
- Usage reporting and analytics
- Payment provider integration

## After Refactoring

### New Service Architecture

#### **Billing Domain Services**

1. **CustomerService** (`billing/customer_service.py`)
   - **Responsibility**: Customer CRUD operations
   - **Dependencies**: PaymentProvider, Database
   - **Size**: ~150 lines
   - **Methods**: create_customer_for_org, get_customer_by_org, update_customer

2. **SubscriptionService** (`billing/subscription_service.py`)
   - **Responsibility**: Subscription lifecycle management
   - **Dependencies**: PaymentProvider, Database
   - **Size**: ~200 lines
   - **Methods**: get_subscription_for_org, create_or_update_subscription, cancel_subscription

3. **CheckoutService** (`billing/checkout_service.py`)
   - **Responsibility**: Checkout session creation
   - **Dependencies**: PaymentProvider, CustomerService
   - **Size**: ~120 lines
   - **Methods**: create_checkout_session, create_plan_change_checkout, create_trial_checkout

4. **WebhookService** (`billing/webhook_service.py`)
   - **Responsibility**: Webhook processing and event handling
   - **Dependencies**: PaymentProvider, CustomerService, SubscriptionService
   - **Size**: ~200 lines
   - **Methods**: process_webhook, _handle_subscription_event, _handle_invoice_event

#### **Budget & Usage Domain Services**

5. **BudgetEnforcementService** (`budget/budget_enforcement_service.py`)
   - **Responsibility**: Budget validation and enforcement
   - **Dependencies**: Database only
   - **Size**: ~250 lines
   - **Methods**: check_budget_before_usage, update_budgets_for_usage, get_budget_violations

6. **CostCalculationService** (`usage/cost_calculation_service.py`)
   - **Responsibility**: Cost calculations and pricing
   - **Dependencies**: None (pure calculation logic)
   - **Size**: ~200 lines
   - **Methods**: calculate_cost, calculate_invocation_cost, estimate_invocation_cost

#### **Orchestrator Services**

7. **BillingOrchestrator** (`billing_orchestrator.py`)
   - **Responsibility**: Coordinate complex billing workflows
   - **Dependencies**: All billing services
   - **Size**: ~200 lines
   - **Methods**: setup_organization_billing, create_subscription_checkout, cancel_organization_subscription

8. **UsageOrchestrator** (`usage_orchestrator.py`)
   - **Responsibility**: Coordinate usage tracking and budget enforcement
   - **Dependencies**: BudgetEnforcementService, CostCalculationService, SubscriptionService
   - **Size**: ~250 lines
   - **Methods**: record_agent_invocation, check_budget_before_invocation, get_usage_summary

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
- Each service has one clear responsibility
- Easier to understand and maintain
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific features

### 2. **Improved Testability**
- Smaller services are easier to unit test
- Dependencies are explicit and can be mocked
- Test coverage is more focused and comprehensive

### 3. **Better Separation of Concerns**
- Billing logic is separate from usage tracking
- Cost calculation is independent of database operations
- Budget enforcement is isolated from payment provider integration

### 4. **Flexible Composition**
- Services can be used independently or composed via orchestrators
- Easy to swap implementations (e.g., different cost calculation strategies)
- API endpoints can use individual services or orchestrators as needed

### 5. **Clearer Dependencies**
- Service dependencies are explicit in constructors
- No circular dependencies
- Easy to understand data flow

## Service Dependency Graph

```
PaymentProvider
    ↓
CustomerService
    ↓
CheckoutService

PaymentProvider + CustomerService + SubscriptionService
    ↓
WebhookService

Database
    ↓
BudgetEnforcementService

(No dependencies)
    ↓
CostCalculationService

All Billing Services
    ↓
BillingOrchestrator

BudgetEnforcementService + CostCalculationService + SubscriptionService
    ↓
UsageOrchestrator
```

## Migration Strategy

### 1. **Backward Compatibility**
- Original service interfaces are maintained through orchestrators
- Existing API endpoints updated to use orchestrators
- No breaking changes to external APIs

### 2. **Gradual Adoption**
- New features use the refactored services
- Existing code can be migrated incrementally
- Both approaches can coexist during transition

### 3. **Testing Strategy**
- Comprehensive tests for individual services
- Integration tests for orchestrators
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows

## Usage Examples

### Using Individual Services

```python
# Direct service usage for simple operations
customer_service = CustomerService(db, payment_provider)
customer = await customer_service.create_customer_for_org(org_id, email)

cost_calculator = CostCalculationService()
cost = cost_calculator.calculate_cost("invocation", 1)
```

### Using Orchestrators

```python
# Orchestrator usage for complex workflows
billing_orchestrator = BillingOrchestrator(db)
checkout_session = await billing_orchestrator.create_subscription_checkout(
    org_id, plan_id, success_url, cancel_url
)

usage_orchestrator = UsageOrchestrator(db)
usage_records = await usage_orchestrator.record_agent_invocation(
    org_id, agent_id, run_id, input_tokens, output_tokens
)
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. **Reduced Memory Footprint**
- Smaller service classes use less memory
- Services can be instantiated only when needed
- Better garbage collection due to smaller objects

### 2. **Improved Caching**
- Individual services can implement focused caching strategies
- Cost calculation service can cache pricing rates
- Customer service can cache frequently accessed customers

### 3. **Better Concurrency**
- Smaller services have fewer locks and contention points
- Independent services can be scaled separately
- Async operations are more granular and efficient

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Service Registry**
- Implement dependency injection container
- Automatic service discovery and registration
- Configuration-driven service composition

### 2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
- Services can publish events for loose coupling
- Async event processing for better performance
- Audit trail through event sourcing

### 3. **Microservices Migration**
- Individual services can be extracted to separate processes
- API boundaries are already well-defined
- Database can be split along service boundaries

This refactoring provides a solid foundation for future growth while maintaining the existing functionality and improving code quality.
