# Phase 2 Checklist (Milestone-by-Milestone Acceptance Criteria)

## ðŸš€ Phase 2 Status: IN PROGRESS

Phase 2 focuses on interoperability, security hardening, billing, and reproducibility. It builds directly on the completed Phase 1 PoC and moves the platform toward enterprise readiness and cross-agent collaboration.

- Target Window: Months 3â€“4
- KPIs: crossâ€‘agent invocation p50 < 2s; reproducible runs with signed logs
- Carryovers from Phase 1: Stripe integration; builder stub (optional)

### ï¿½ Supporting Documentation
- **[Phase 2 Dependencies](./phase2-dependencies.md)**: Open-source library recommendations with licenses, integration complexity, and risks
- **[Phase 2 Integration Examples](./phase2-integration-examples.md)**: FastAPI code stubs and minimal integration examples for priority libraries

### ï¿½ðŸ“Œ Planned Milestones
- Milestone H: Interoperability Core (MCP/A2A + Tool Sharing + Manifests + Reputation)
- Milestone I: Workspace UI & Organization Settings
- Milestone J: Advanced Security (RBAC/ABAC via OPA, SSO)
- Milestone N: Agent Sandbox Environments & Autonomous Learning
- Milestone K: Billing & Budgets (Stripe Integration)
- Milestone L: Reproducibility & Signed Logs
- Milestone M: Performance & Reliability (p50 < 2s)
